Capstone idea:
Life Sciences Platform: Configure Price Quote (CPQ), featuring Order Management Platform and Notetaking App

Target customers: Contract Research Organizations (CRO’s)

Overview: CRO’s have difficulties in generating quotes quickly and accurately to pharma companies (think: Pfizer) for their scientific services in the pre-clinical trials phase. CRO’s send an average of 20,000 quotes a month. We aim to reduce their time to quote by 50%.
